# klogger

This is a free keylogger for only private and legal use. I don't recommend using this without anyone's consent. Have fun!

1. Change the directories of the attacking process, here I chose iexplore.exe. Open the logging_ie.bat file to change the directory to the location your logger.pyw file is stored, change it in the logging_ie.vbs file aswell.</br>
2. Just start the shortcut of the Internet Explorer or your destination process you chose connected to the logging_ie.vbs file because you want to run this if the shortcut is clicked.</br>
3. Run the server.py file</br>
4. Right after you closed IE or your process, the created keylog will be sent to your the IP address you put in the logger.pyw file. It will probably be saved as "keylog.txt" next to the server.py file.</br>
5. Enjoy the keylog (only for private AND legal purposes!)</br>

Any issues? Let me know.
